abstract: >
  CLAP is a release-governance harness for clinical language models that produces
  regulatory-audit-style evidence packets. It generates synthetic
  counterfactual-family datasets, runs multi-model evaluation via pluggable
  adapters, and computes governance metrics (CFC, SNG, FC, PC) with explicit
  release gates. CLAP is designed for reproducible deployment-grade evaluation
  using fully synthetic data only. No PHI; evaluation research only.
