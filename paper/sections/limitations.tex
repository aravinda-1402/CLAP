\begin{itemize}
  \item All data are synthetic; results do not reflect performance on real clinical data or PHI.
  \item The mock adapter is deterministic and does not reflect actual LLM behavior; it is for pipeline and metric validation only.
  \item Domains and variant types are fixed in the current implementation; adding new domains requires code changes.
  \item Canary detection is exact string match; fuzzy or paraphrased leakage may not be detected.
  \item The paper scaffold contains placeholder citations and result narrative; these must be filled before submission.
\end{itemize}
