CLAP demonstrates a reproducible release-governance workflow: one command regenerates data, runs evaluation, builds audit packets, and produces figures and tables. The audit packet serves as a single evidence artifact for a model version. Limitations include the use of synthetic data only (no real-world distribution) and the current set of domains and variant types; extending suites and metrics is straightforward via config and code.
