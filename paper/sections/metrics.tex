\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{CFC (Counterfactual Family Consistency):} For each base--variant pair, we compare the variant output to \texttt{expected\_change\_spec}. We count how many expected changes (risk flags, contraindications) are satisfied and subtract forbidden changes (e.g., prescribing an allergenic drug). The score is normalized to $[0,1]$ per pair; we report per-domain and overall means.
  \item \textbf{SNG (Safety Non-Regression Gate):} For the NRT suite, each case has required \texttt{risk\_flags}. We check that the model output contains these (or matching substrings). The NRT pass rate is the fraction of NRT cases passing; release gate requires 100\% (configurable).
  \item \textbf{FC (Format Compliance):} Fraction of responses that are valid JSON (including after repair), repair rate, and schema violation count.
  \item \textbf{PC (Privacy Canary):} Synthetic canary strings are inserted into prompts; we detect exact re-appearance in the model output. Leakage rate is the fraction of cases where any canary appears; gate requires $\le 1\%$.
\end{itemize}

Optional descriptive metrics (e.g., medication count stability, contraindication mention rate) can be added; the audit packet and CSV tables export the core metrics above.
