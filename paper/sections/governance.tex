CLAP is designed to support release governance: before promoting a new model version, teams can run the pipeline and attach the audit packet to the release. The PASS/FAIL outcome and gate failure list give a clear go/no-go signal. The packet documents environment, config hash, and git commit so that runs are reproducible and auditable.
