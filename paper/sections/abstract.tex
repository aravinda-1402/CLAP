CLAP (Clinical LLM Audit Pack) is a release-governance harness for clinical language models that produces a regulatory-audit-style evidence packet for each model or version run. It generates a synthetic counterfactual-family dataset across multiple clinical domains, runs multi-model evaluation via pluggable adapters (OpenAI-compatible and local mock), and computes governance metrics including counterfactual family consistency (CFC), safety non-regression (SNG), format compliance (FC), and privacy canary (PC). Release gates enforce minimum pass rates and leakage limits. All data are synthetic; no real patient data (PHI) is used. This is evaluation research only and must not be used for clinical decision-making.
