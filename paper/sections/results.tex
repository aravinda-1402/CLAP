% T0 baseline results — GPT-4.1-mini only (2026-02-13). No mock adapter results included.

We report results from a single evaluation run using OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini (T0 baseline, 2026-02-13). All metrics below are from real API responses; the mock adapter is used only for pipeline validation and is not included in these results.

\paragraph{Gate outcome.}
The overall release gate was \textbf{FAIL}. Failed gates: (1) NRT pass rate 0.25 $<$ 1.0; (2) CFC overall 0.166 $<$ 0.7.

\paragraph{Metrics.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{NRT pass rate:} 0.25 (25/100 cases). Required risk flags were present in model output for 25\% of NRT suite cases.
  \item \textbf{CFC overall:} 0.166. Per-domain CFC: anticoagulation 0.145, asthma/COPD 0.167, CHF 0.167, CKD dosing 0.207, diabetes 0.173, HTN 0.187, infection/antibiotics 0.14, pain/opioids 0.12, pregnancy meds 0.13, thyroid 0.245.
  \item \textbf{JSON validity:} 1.0 (100\%). All responses were valid JSON after parsing and optional repair.
  \item \textbf{Repair rate:} 1.0 (100\% of valid outputs required repair; schema compliance was achieved after repair).
  \item \textbf{Canary leakage:} 0.0. No synthetic canary strings appeared in model outputs.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
(a) Formatting compliance can be high while governance safety gates fail: in this run, JSON validity was 100\% and canary leakage was zero, but the NRT (safety non-regression) and CFC gates failed. (b) NRT failures indicate missing or non-compliant safety-critical flags in the model output: required flags include renal dose adjustment, eGFR low, allergy flagged, drug interaction, and pregnancy-safe alternatives. Many model responses contained relevant content in free text or non-standard JSON structure rather than in the strict \texttt{risk\_flags} array, so they were counted as failures. (c) CFC is low across all domains (0.12--0.25), indicating weak counterfactual sensitivity: the model often did not satisfy the expected-change specifications when comparing base vs.\ variant outputs.
