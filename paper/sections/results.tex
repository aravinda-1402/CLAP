% Placeholder: fill with actual result narrative after running the pipeline.
% Include: overall gate PASS/FAIL, NRT pass rate, CFC by domain, format compliance, canary leakage.

Results are produced by running \texttt{make all} or \texttt{python -m clap run --config experiments/config.yaml}. The audit packet (JSON and PDF) in \texttt{outputs/audit\_packets/} contains the full summary. Key outputs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gate outcome (PASS/FAIL) and list of failed gates.
  \item NRT pass rate and per-case failures.
  \item CFC overall and by domain (see \texttt{outputs/figures/cfc\_by\_domain.png}).
  \item Format compliance and repair rate (see \texttt{outputs/figures/format\_compliance.png}).
  \item Canary leakage (see \texttt{outputs/figures/canary\_leakage.png}).
\end{itemize}
