Clinical language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered for decision-support and documentation tasks. Before deployment, teams need reproducible evidence of safety, consistency, and compliance. CLAP provides a single pipeline that: (1) generates a synthetic clinical counterfactual-family dataset with explicit expected changes; (2) evaluates models via a strict JSON output contract; (3) computes CFC, SNG, FC, and PC metrics; (4) applies configurable release gates; and (5) produces an audit packet in JSON and PDF form, plus publication-ready figures and tables. The key novelty is the \emph{audit packet} and \emph{release gating} workflow, not only metrics in isolation.

\paragraph{Synthetic data disclaimer.}
All cases in the CLAP dataset are synthetic. No real patient data or protected health information (PHI) is used. Identifiers and demographics are fictional and labeled as such. The system is intended for evaluation and release governance research only.
