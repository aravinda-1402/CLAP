No real patient data or PHI is used. All case content is synthetic and clearly labeled. CLAP is for evaluation and release-governance research only; it must not be used to generate medical advice or for direct clinical decision-making. Users should ensure compliance with local regulations and institutional review when using or extending the framework.
