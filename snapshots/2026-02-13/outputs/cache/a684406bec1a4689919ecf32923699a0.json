This may indicate suboptimal thyroid hormone replacement or early undertreatment.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Consider evaluating patient's symptoms and adherence to levothyroxine. Recheck thyroid function tests in 6-8 weeks after potential dose adjustment. Monitor for signs of hypothyroid symptoms or overreplacement. No immediate urgent intervention required based on current vitals and labs.\",\n  \"follow_up\": \"Repeat TSH and free T4 in 6-8 weeks with clinical reassessment.\"\n}\n```",
